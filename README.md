# Old Style Calculator.exe
## Description

**Old Style Calculator.exe** is a standalone, retro-themed calculator built in Python (Tkinter) and packed into an executable for that *vintage Windows XP* look.  
It brings back the classic feel of early 2000s calculators — simple, tan buttons, a blue screen, and green text — the true old-school aesthetic.  

It’s lightweight, fully offline, and gives instant nostalgia without needing Python installed.

Basic arithmetic operations: +, -, ×, ÷
